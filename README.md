# Demeter : Intelligence for CAST Imaging

## Introduction

The Demeter is a project whose ambition is to industrialize the actions on Imaging. Make it easy to check for
application configuration issues, quickly address a list of use cases and get statistics allowing you to get a deeper
and clearer view of your application.

It will allow you to quickly get the information you want from Imaging through the creation of Tag and Document.
Furthermore, the extension includes a module to generate a report based on what has been detected inside your
application, to help you refine your approach.

The Tagging-Extension comes as an extension for the Neo4j Database with its own enriched knowledge database.
